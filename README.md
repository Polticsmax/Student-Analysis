 # Project Description
This project analyzes student performance during a 7-day Python workshop with the objective of evaluating whether a mentor's teaching effectiveness correlates with student performance in daily assessments. Daily feedback data is collected from students, cleaned, and structured to track trends across the week. The goal is to gain insights into how well students are grasping concepts and whether instructional quality directly impacts student understanding.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown:
### Step 1: Import Required Libraries
The code begins by importing essential Python libraries like pandas and numpy, which are used for handling data and performing numerical computations.

### Step 2 : Load Daily Feedback Files
Excel files containing student feedback from Day 1 to Day 7 are loaded using pd.read_excel(). Each file represents feedback submitted by students on a particular day.

### Step 3 : Clean and Format Each Day's Data
Irrelevant columns such as Timestamp are dropped, and key columns are renamed to maintain consistency. Each dataset is then structured with standardized column names: Instructor_exp, Learning_exp, and Self_exp.

### Step 4 : Standardize Structure Across All Days
All seven datasets are processed using similar cleaning logic to ensure they have the same structure, allowing for easy comparison across days.

### Step 5 : Analyze Instructor and Student Ratings
The cleaned data enables a comparative analysis of instructor ratings (Instructor_exp) and self-rated learning (Self_exp) to observe how teaching quality aligns with student comprehension.

### Step 6 : Interpret Daily Trends
Trends over the 7-day period help assess whether studentsâ€™ learning improved alongside higher instructor ratings. It also highlights days with possible gaps in understanding or teaching quality.

### Draw Final Insights
By comparing feedback across the week, the project assesses if improved teaching led to better learning outcomes, fulfilling the central goal of analyzing teaching impact through data.

# Summary
This project explores student feedback collected during a 7-day Python workshop to understand the impact of mentorship on learning outcomes. Using Python and pandas, daily feedback is cleaned and standardized to identify trends in instructor performance and student comprehension. By comparing ratings over time, it helps determine if better teaching correlates with improved student understanding. The analysis provides valuable insights into instructional effectiveness, offering a data-driven approach to evaluating teaching strategies and student learning progress across a structured training program.
